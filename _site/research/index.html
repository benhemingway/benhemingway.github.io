<p><strong>Banking regulation and collateral screening in a model of information
asymmetry</strong> <a href="/assets/papers/BankReg_AsymInfo.pdf">Paper</a></p>

<p>The role of collateral in debt contracts is explored within an environment of aggregate risk and banking regulation. I model a credit market with imperfect information and aggregate uncertainty. Banks have limited liability and do not endogenize the value of insured deposits, creating a problem of over-lending. This inefficiency can be corrected through banking regulation. I consider two regulatory tools, capital requirements and a regulatory stress-test. The stress-test provides a dual role for collateral. First, it can help mitigate the adverse selection problem by acting as a screening device. Second it also helps the bank satisfy any regulatory constraint by reducing the loss given default that the bank suffers in bad states of the world. Banking regulation impacts both the loan terms and the type of equilibrium, if firms do not have sufficient collateral, a pooling equilibrium exists.</p>

<p><strong>Macroeconomic implications of insolvency regimes</strong> [Under revision]</p>

<p>This paper investigates how creditor and debtor rights in the case of firm insolvency impact on the equilibrium outcomes in a firm dynamics model. I build a heterogeneous firm model with financial frictions where defaulting firms can enter insolvency and continue production or be liquidated and exit. Financial frictions impact firm production decisions and make capital relatively more costly than labour for borrowing constrained firms. As a result, financially constrained firms are less capital intensive and have a lower capital-to-labour ratio than unconstrained firms. Two insolvency regimes are compared, a creditor-friendly regime such as the UK and a debtor-friendly regime such as the US. Debtor-friendly regimes are shown to be more costly in the steady-state, leading to larger spreads on firm debt. The model dynamics find a response to productivity shocks that are largely consistent with the UK and the US following the financial crisis. I show that the model provides a precise account for the differential effects of productivity shocks across economies that differ in the credit/debtor rights. In particular, in an application to the financial crisis, I show that labour productivity falls more sharply in the creditor-friendly regime while employment does not. This paper suggests a possible explanation for the different employment and labour productivity response in the UK and US since the financial crisis.</p>

<p><strong>A Model of Credit Rationing in SME Loan Applications</strong> [Available on request]</p>

<p>This paper is concerned with building  a modelling framework for the study of SME loan applications that is consistent with existing survey data. Specifically, it aims to capture several observable features of the loan market. First, firms choose whether they apply for a loan, and firms that do not apply for loans may not need a loan, or may think they will not obtain a loan. Second, a firm’s loan application may not be successful. A firm may receive only part of the funding it had requested, or it may have its loan application outright. By explicitly modelling the loan application phase, I am able to justify why firms apply for loans and are still subsequently rejected. This chapter also provides a theoretical contribution in that there is the possibility, in a model without asymmetric information, of ‘pure credit rationing’ where observationally equivalent firms are granted a loan with while others are not. This result is made possible because of the additional loan application phase.</p>

<p><strong>The effect of the financial crisis on bank lending to SMEs</strong> joint with <a href="https://alancrawford.github.io/">Alan Crawford</a></p>

<p>In this paper we develop a model of bank lending to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). Combining a bi-annual survey of European SME financing decisions with a contemporaneous EU-wide banking conditions survey, we empirically evaluate the determinants of successful loan applications during the financial crisis.</p>
