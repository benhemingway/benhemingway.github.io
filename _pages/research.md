**Macroeconomic implications of bankruptcy regimes**

Abstract This paper investigates the importance of creditor and debtor rights in bankruptcy on firm production decisions. I build a heterogeneous firm model with financial frictions where defaulting firms can enter bankruptcy and continue production or be liquidated and exit. Financial frictions impact firm production decisions as firms must pay for capital and wages at the beginning of the period. First, the model finds that financially constrained firms are less capital intensive and have a lower capital-to-labour ratio than unconstrained firms. Second, it is shown that creditor-friendly regimes result in fewer defaults and worse outcomes for defaulting firms when compared to debtor-friendly regimes. A creditor-friendly bankruptcy regime is shown to lead to higher aggregate capital-to-labour ratios in the steady-state compared to a debtor-friendly regime. The dynamic response to negative shocks is also considered.

**The effect of the financial crisis on bank lending to SMEs** joint with [Alan Crawford](https://alancrawford.github.io/)

In this paper we develop a model of bank lending to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). Combining a bi-annual survey of European SME financing decisions with a contemporaneous EU-wide banking conditions survey, we empirical evaluate the determinants of successful loan applications during the financial crisis.

**Debt maturity in a model of liquidity requirements and information asymmetry**

Following the financial crisis there was a renewed emphasis on banking regulation, including the strengthening of liquidity requirements. At the same time, in the face of increased lending banks were reducing their lending. This paper explores the role debt maturity plays as a screening device in the presence of information asymmetry and bank liquidity requirements. The tightening of liquidity requirements makes long-term lending more costly and screening of borrowers becomes more difficult, leading to a misallocation of capital.
