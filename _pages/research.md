**[Banking regulation and collateral screening in a model of information
asymmetry](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10693-021-00357-w)**<br/>

This paper explores the impact of banking regulation on a competitive credit market with ex-ante asymmetric information and aggregate uncertainty. I construct a model where the government imposes a regulatory constraint that limits the losses banks make in the event of their default. I show that the addition of banking regulation results in three deviations from the standard theory. First, collateral is demanded of both high and low risk firms, even in the absence of asymmetric information. Second, if banking regulation is sufficiently strict, there may not exist an adverse selection problem. Third, a pooling Nash equilibrium can exist.

# Working Papers

**[Macroeconomic implications of insolvency regimes](/assets/papers/Insolvency_Regimes.pdf)**<br/>
*Also available as [Bank of Lithuania Working Paper No 77.](https://www.lb.lt/uploads/publications/docs/26008_1997892e97b2105c6033975eca02ae09.pdf)*<br/>
The impact of creditor and debtor rights following firm insolvency are studied in a firm dynamics model where defaulting firms choose between restructuring or exit. The model accounts for differing effects of productivity shocks across economies that differ in the credit/debtor rights. Following a negative shock labour productivity falls sharply in a creditor-friendly regime such as the UK while in a debtor-friendly regime such as the US, there is a larger employment response. This paper suggests a possible explanation for the different employment and labour productivity response in the UK and US since the financial crisis.

**A Model of Credit Rationing in SME Loan Applications** [Under Revision]<br/>
This paper analyzes competition in a credit market in which firms choose between applying to a banking sector or a perfectly competitive external lender. Banks have an informational advantage over the external lenders in the form of imperfect and independent tests. The model predicts that, controlling for observable borrower risk, the probability that firms apply for a bank loan is decreasing in the level of competition in the banking sector, which is consistent with the empirical evidence. The model suggests that firms of intermediate observable borrower risk are most likely to apply for bank loans as these firms benefit most from the additional information banks receive. An extension of the model to allow for variable loan size yields testable predictions linking the outcome of loan applications to the level of banking competition.

# Work in Progress

**The effect of the financial crisis on bank lending to SMEs** joint with [Alan Crawford](https://alancrawford.github.io/)<br/>
In this paper we develop a model of bank lending to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). Combining a bi-annual survey of European SME financing decisions with a contemporaneous EU-wide banking conditions survey, we empirically evaluate the determinants of successful loan applications during the financial crisis.
