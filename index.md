## Welcome
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at University College London. My research fields are macroeconomics, firm dynamics and the study of financial frictions. In my current work, I study the impact of insolvency regimes on firm production decisions. I find that in a creditor-friendly regime such as the UK firms substitute from capital to labour in response to a shock. This suggest a possible explanation for the different employment and labour productivity response in the UK and US since the Financial Crisis.

I am on the job market this year and will be available for interviews at the 2018 ASSA Annual Meeting in Philadelphia, the SAEe meetings in Barcelona and the RES meetings in London.

My main interests are Macroeconomics, Firm Dynamics, and Corporate Finance.
